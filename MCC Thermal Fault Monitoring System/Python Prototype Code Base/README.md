## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a preventive maintenance system for Motor Control Center (MCC) units. The system will enable early detection of thermal hotspots (referred to as “spotting”) on the internal wiring of 600V MCC units. By identifying anomalies before failure occurs, this solution aims to improve equipment reliability, extend asset lifespan, and reduce downtime.
