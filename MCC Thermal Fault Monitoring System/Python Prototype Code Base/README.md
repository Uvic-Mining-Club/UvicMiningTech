## Project Description

This project aims to develop a rugged, industrial-grade sensor system designed to detect faults in a mining MCC (Motor Control Center) unit. The system will continuously monitor key parameters and relay real-time information to a remote display or control system, allowing operators to respond quickly and appropriately to any detected issues.
