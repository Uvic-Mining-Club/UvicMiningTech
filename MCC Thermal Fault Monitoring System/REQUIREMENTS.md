## Introduction / Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a preventive maintenance system for Motor Control Center (MCC) units. The system will enable early detection of thermal hotspots (referred to as “spotting”) on the internal wiring of 600V MCC units. By identifying anomalies before failure occurs, this solution aims to improve equipment reliability, extend asset lifespan, and reduce downtime.

## Scope

### In-Scope

- Hardware configuration for MCC unit monitoring
- Thermal or infrared camera integration
- Protective casing and secure mounting system
- Power supply unit (capable of stepping up or down as needed)
- One or more output interfaces (wired or wireless communication)
- Image processing and hotspot detection functionality

### Out-of-Scope

- Automated or reactionary control measures (e.g., shutting down MCC units)
- User-facing graphical display or GUI software

## Functional Requirements

The system shall:

1. Detect thermal hotspots (“spotting”) on 600V MCC unit wiring.
   - _Spotting is defined as wiring that exceeds normal operating temperature thresholds, typically caused by degraded insulation or excessive current flow._
2. Capture and process thermal images using an integrated or external camera.
3. Log all detected anomalies with timestamp and location metadata.
4. Transmit detection reports and/or export captured images to a remote access terminal for manual inspection.
5. Provide at least one form of output communication (e.g., USB, Ethernet, or wireless).
6. Allow authorized users to configure detection thresholds and reporting intervals.
7. Continue operation under normal MCC environmental conditions (temperature, dust, vibration).

## Non-Functional Requirements

The system shall meet the following quality attributes:

1. **Performance**

   - Image processing and hotspot detection shall occur within 2 seconds of image capture.
   - Detection accuracy shall be ≥ 95% when tested under controlled hotspot simulation.

2. **Reliability and Availability**

   - System uptime shall be ≥ 99% during continuous operation.
   - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) shall meet or exceed 12 months.

3. **Power Efficiency**

   - The system shall consume less than 15W under normal operating conditions.
   - The system shall support low-power standby mode when not actively monitoring.

4. **Compliance and Standards**

   - The system shall comply with relevant IEEE, IEC, and CSA standards for electrical safety and monitoring equipment.
   - All data transmission shall comply with applicable cybersecurity best practices.

5. **Environmental Durability**

   - The system shall be rugged and resistant to:
     - Heat up to 70°C (operating temperature range).
     - Dust ingress (IP54 rating or higher).
     - Vibration consistent with MCC operating environments.

6. **Maintainability**
   - The system shall support remote firmware updates.
   - The system shall allow component replacement without requiring specialized tools.

## Assumptions

- MCC units are accessible for installation of monitoring equipment.
- Adequate network connectivity (wired or wireless) is available for data transmission.
- Personnel responsible for inspections have access to the exported reports/images.
- Operating environment includes elevated temperatures, dust, and vibrations typical of mining sites.

## Constraints

- Budgetary constraints may limit the use of advanced imaging sensors.
- System must operate without interfering with MCC unit operation.
- Physical installation must comply with safety and clearance requirements for high-voltage equipment.
- Development timeline constrained to academic project schedule.
