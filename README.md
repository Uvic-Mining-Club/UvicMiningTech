## About Us

We are a team of interdisciplinary engineering students at the University of Victoria, Canada. Our mission is to design and develop innovative solutions for industrial and mining applications, with a strong focus on automation, safety, and predictive maintenance. Through hands-on, real-world problem-solving, we aim to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and safety of mining operations.

Currently, we are in the planning phase of several projects, exploring both software and hardware approaches to improve mining technologies. Our work includes automated fault detection for electrical equipment in mining environments. In addition to developing technical skills, our club provides opportunities for students to connect with industry professionals, gain insight into real mining operations, and prepare for careers in the mining and industrial technology sectors.
